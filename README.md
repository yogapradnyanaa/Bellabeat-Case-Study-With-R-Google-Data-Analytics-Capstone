## 2. Prepare

***🗂Data stored***

Sršen encourages to use public data that explores smart device users’ daily habits. The dataset is from (CC0: Public Domain, dataset made available through Mobius). This dataset generated by respondents to a distributed survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk between 03.12.2016-05.12.2016. 

Thirty eligible Fitbit users consented to the submission of personal tracker data, including minute-level output for physical activity, heart rate, and sleep monitoring. It includes information about daily activity, steps, and heart rate that can be used to explore users’ habits.

***✅Data Credibility Analysis – ROCCC Approach (Reliable, Original, Comprehensive, Current, Cited)***
  
- 📉Reliable (Low):
The data includes only 30 users collected through a survey via Amazon Mechanical Turk, which is the minimum sample size required for basic statistical analysis. However, given the limited sample size, the data is not sufficiently reliable for generalizing to the entire smartwatch user population. As a result, it may be biased and unrepresentative of the broader user base.

- 📉Original (Low):
The data was obtained from a third-party source (a survey conducted via Amazon Mechanical Turk) and not collected directly by Bellabeat. Therefore, its accuracy and relevance to Bellabeat’s specific needs may be limited.

- 📉Comperhensive (Low):
The dataset has only three months of time range, which may limit the ability to observe long term trend. Dataset lacks detailed demographic information such as age or location. Without this context, it's hard to understand whether the observed patterns apply to Bellabeat’s target market.

- 📉Current (Low):
The dataset was collected in 2016, and since then, health habits, device usage patterns, and technology adoption have evolved significantly. As a result, the insights derived from this data may be less relevant or applicable to today's market and business environment.

- 📉Cited (Low):
The dataset was sourced from Amazon Mechanical Turk without clear documentation on who collected the data, how it was collected, or any official citation or publication. The absence of a verifiable source or proper citation undermines the credibility of the data and makes it difficult to validate or replicate the dataset for further analysis.
